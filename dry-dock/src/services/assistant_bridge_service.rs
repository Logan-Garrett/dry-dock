// This Service is simply a bridge to whatever stupid chat bot you want to use for info grabbing. Basically what I am thinking is Model grabbing methods here
// Also need to allow CLI interation or some form of an MCP for file fetching and what not. Maybe even a local LLM integration later down the line.
